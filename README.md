# nacs

**nacs** is a fast and simple 1D/2D barcode scanner that runs in your browser.  
Powered by ZBar (through WebAssembly).

Try it here: [https://arnottferels.github.io/nacs](https://arnottferels.github.io/nacs)

The name? Just "scan" spelled backward.

## Why this exists

Needed a quick way to scan barcodes and QR codes to help with some internal tasks.  
No install, no uploads -- just open and scan.

## How it works

It uses your device camera to read barcodes and QR codes.  
All in the browser. Real-time. Lightweight.
